/**
 * A ModelSet is like a Graph Data Set in SPARQL. It contains a number of named
 * graphs (Models), which might be empty. Additionally, one special unnamed
 * model, the 'Default Model' belongs to a ModelSet.
 * 
 * ModelSet offers a number of methods that make it behave like a quad store,
 * however, when e.g. removing all statements with a certain context, the model
 * named with that context still remains in the ModelSet.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>ModelSet</code> can be read from a named graph aware serialization
 * such as TRIG or TRIX using the read/write methods. If you read a
 * serialization that supports only one graph (like RDF/XML), a default model
 * will be created.
 * </p>
 * 
 * The context URI of the default modell is 'null'.
