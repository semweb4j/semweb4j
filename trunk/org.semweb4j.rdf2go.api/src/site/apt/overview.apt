RDF2Go

  This class is the main entry point (singleton) to get a ModelFactory instance.

ModelFactory

  This class creates implementation-specific implementations of ModelSet and Model
  
Model

  Is an RDF model. As the RDF specs define, an RDF model consist of a number of triples
  of the form (Resource, URI, Node).
  
  The inheritance hierarchy of the node types is:
  
  * Node  
  
    * Resources
    
      * BlankNode
      
      * URI
      
    * Literal
    
      * PlainLiteral
      
      * LanguageTagLiteral
      
      * DatatypeLiteral
      
ModelSet

  A ModelSet is at the same time a set of Models (hence the name) and a quzad store.
  
  A ModelSet has a number of mappings of the form URI - Model. In another way,
  each ModelSet is (URI, Resource, URI, Node). But the quad-store view is 
  not entirely true, as each ModelSet has to remember which Models (even empty ones)
  belong to it. SO there can be more Models in a ModelSet than different URIs in a quad.
  
  If adding a Statement to a ModelSet, the contextURI of the statement becomes 
  the URI of the graph.
