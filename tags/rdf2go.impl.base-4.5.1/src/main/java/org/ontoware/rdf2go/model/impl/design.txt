notes for the desing of AbstractModel and AbstractModelSet

contains(...) and iterator() calls find(...)





The abstract methods thad *must* be implemented
should have aggregated objects (statement, quadpatter) in their
signature, instead of parameters split up (subject, predicate,
object => statement).
then its easier to implement subclasses.
