Issues

  How to handle remote blank nodes? if the identity of an object is based 
  on a bnode, it cannot be used to get/set/anything.

  Idea: 
  
  use a CompletelyDescribedBlankNode, which is a blank node plus 
  a set of statements to describe the blank node (like a MSG)
  
  
  
Velocity

  If the template is not in the root of the JAR, velocity ClassResourceLoader 
  cannot find it. 

  If it's not in a source path, the classload cannot find it when 
  executed stand-alone.

  See {{http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/docs/api/org/apache/velocity/runtime/resource/loader/ClasspathResourceLoader.html}}
