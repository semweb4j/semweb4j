Thoughts

syntax:

----
existing code, like the RDFBase classes?

? generated classes should not overwrite existing methods
  " type for CDS overwrote type from RDF
    * 
    
    
? deal with multiple namespace/multiple ontologies
 * load them all, threat them as one rdf model
  ? if different ontology languages?
   * could map to the same internal model
   * rare case
  ? how to deal with different namespaces?
   * prefix generated classes like 'getRdfType' 'getCdsType'
    ? longer names, bad. 'getType' would be nicer
     * make all internal method names long      
     
? multiple domains?
 * no problem
 
? multiple ranges
 * fall back to resource
  ? weak typing, error prone
 * use 'getFriend' and 'getFriend_asPerson' 
   and 'addFriend(Person p)' and 'addFriend(Dog p)
  + easy to implement
   ? how
    * model multiple ranges in JModel
 * generate common type 'PersonAndDog'
  + can be combined with '_asYYY'
  ? should inherit from Person and Dog
   - nobody cares
