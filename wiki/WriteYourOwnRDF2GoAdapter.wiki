#summary How to write a RDF2GO adapter for your triplestore
#labels rdf2go,Phase-Implementation,Featured

First you need to decide if you want to implement only a triple store adapter  or a quad store adapter. 

A triple store in RDF2Go is a _Model_ (s,p,o), a quad store is a _ModelSet_ (c,s,p,o). 
  * c - context URI
  * s - subject URI or blank node
  * p - property URI
  * o - object URI, blank node or literal

A ModelSet always has tha ability to be used as a set of named models (c -> s, p, o).

=== Walk-through of Sesame 2.3.1 Implementation ===

You need to extend AbstractModel and implement the abstract methods.

Second, you need a _[http://code.google.com/p/semweb4j/source/browse/trunk/org.semweb4j.rdf2go.impl.sesame23/src/main/java/org/ontoware/rdf2go/impl/StaticBinding.java StaticBinding]_ to register your implementation. This allows the _RDF2Go_ class to create models based on your adapter.

The _[http://code.google.com/p/semweb4j/source/browse/trunk/org.semweb4j.rdf2go.impl.sesame23/src/main/java/org/openrdf/rdf2go/RepositoryModel.java RepositoryModel]_ of the Sesame/OpenRDF 2.3.1 adapter is less than 900 lines long and in production use.
